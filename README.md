# UML Generator That Works
UML generator for Java that actually works, in Rust.

# What?

This is still a work in progress. The objective of this project is to develop a generator that interprets and converts a Java project or file into an UML.

# Why?

Because none of the existing UML generators I've seen seem to work properly (or at least the way I want them to).

# ...Why?²

Let's agree for a second... I know, we're all developers and this can be impossible sometimes but, hear me out on this one: Making UMLs is ***NOT FUN!*** It's so much manual work and takes so much time that could be used for coding.  

As developers, we wan't to code, fail miserably for a lack of proper documentation and guidelines to follow and then debug everything until it works! (right guys?)  

So that's where *uml-gen-tw* comes into play, you can code everything and then let *uml-gen-tw* take care of that boring UML that your manager (superior, instructor, professor) asks you to make. 

That's perfect, right?

# YES!

Yeah, I know. However, I'm currently way busier than when I started this project, so if you want to see it done you'll have to wait or PR :)
